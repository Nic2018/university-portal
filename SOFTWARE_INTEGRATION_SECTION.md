# Software Integration

The Campus Event Scheduling and Space Management System integrates three subsystems—Administrator Subsystem (Ng Wen Pin), User Booking and Interaction Subsystem (Yeap Wei Hong), and Interactive Utilities and AI Subsystem (Ali Osman)—using Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration. We adopted a centralized repository approach where all team members commit their code to a shared GitHub repository at https://github.com/Nic2018/university-portal. Team members follow a standard Git workflow: first, they check the status of local changes using `git status`, then stage files for commit using `git add <filename>`, commit changes with a descriptive message using `git commit -m "message"`, and finally push to GitHub using `git push origin main`. The three subsystems are integrated through a shared SQLite database (`db.sqlite3`) containing user accounts, venue information, booking records, and system logs; Django URL routing where each subsystem has dedicated paths (`/admin/` for Administrator, `/booking/` for User Booking, and `/map/` and `/bot/` for Interactive Utilities); and shared base templates (`base.html`) that ensure consistent UI across all subsystems. This integration strategy provides complete version control with a history of all code changes, enables multiple developers to work simultaneously, stores code securely on GitHub as a backup, and provides traceability to track who made what changes and when.
