# ▶️ One-click runserver (VS Code)

This project includes convenient ways to start the Django dev server with one click.

- Press **F5** in VS Code and select **Run Django Server** to start the server in the integrated terminal.
- Or open **Terminal → Run Task...** and choose **Run Django Server (task)**.
- Or double-click `runserver.bat` (Windows) at the project root to start the server and open http://127.0.0.1:8000.

> Tip: Make sure the correct Python interpreter / virtualenv is selected in VS Code (bottom-left). The launch task uses the active interpreter.
